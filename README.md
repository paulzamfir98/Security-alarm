# Security Alarm
Security alarm made with Arduino.

## Description
This system was developed in order to improve home security.
The security alarm is based on an ultrasonic distance sensor which sends information to an Arduino board, in order to check a person's presence. As long as the alarm is activated and the sensor detects a breach, the alarm goes off by
activating a blinking LED and a piezoelectric buzzer with a powerful sound. To stop the alarm, you have 2 attempts to input the 4 digit code correctly.(default password:1234
